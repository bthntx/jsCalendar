#Javascript calendar.

https://bthntx.github.io/jsCalendar/

Using HTML, CSS, MooTools/jQuery, and Javascript, (but do not use a third party calendar widget) - create an interactive calendar webpage that:

* Shows one month at a time

* Allows the user to navigate to another month in any year

* Allows the user to add an “event” to any date that will then be highlighted in some way to show the user that there is an event on that date. An “event” is just a short string associated with a date.

* If the webpage is refreshed, the events should/may be forgotten (i.e., you only need to save the events in the javascript, you do not need to save them persistently)
You should incorporate a javascript library to create as interesting of a user interaction as possible (e.g., using animation is a good start)
